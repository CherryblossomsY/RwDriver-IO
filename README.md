# RwDriver-IO

Hello everyone! This is my debut project as I venture into the realm of programming, specifically in the field of input/output operations. While it may only encompass basic read and write functionalities, I am truly elated by the abundance of code references and insights drawn from the remarkable capabilities of GPT. Despite acknowledging the subpar quality of this code, it holds immense personal significance for me.


This project encompasses system source files and executable invocations; however, the installation of the driver file requires manual intervention. Moreover, within the source code of the executable, one must modify the PID and address or inject predetermined values.
